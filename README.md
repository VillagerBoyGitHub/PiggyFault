Hello everyone. I made a Minecraft PvP texture pack for Minecraft 1.8.9.

This texture pack improves the Minecraft PvP experience, has a nice black GUI, makes the swords shorter, improves the armour texture, improves the bed texture, it changes the water bucket, and more.

This is my first public texture pacfk after all, so if you'd like to download it, the link is below. I also took some screenshots to give a preview of how the texture pack looks.

If you'd like to help us with this texture pack, please tell us in the comments down below. We will review them as soon as possible.
